# Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS

> How to create a serverless Progressive Web App, using React, Redux, React Router, TypeScript on frontend and AWS Lambda, Cloudfront, Amazon SES, API Gateway for a zero maintenance required backend.

## Brand

You need a *project name*, possibly matching your domain. This name will be used everywhere in different contexts: as is, lowercase, without spaces, as a prefix etc.
Project name in the following snippets will be **Acme**. Actually there is a side project of mine,
that implements this tutorial and some links below point to it: [aws-map.com](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com). In that case you may find its name, that is *AWS Map*.

## Route53

Create *your-domain.com* hosted zone and configure domain provider with AWS name servers.

On *Route53*:

On your domain provider:

![Configure name servers](./images/Route53-Configure_name_servers.png)

## SSL Certificate

Go to *Certificate Manager* AWS service. Request an SSL certificate for _your-domain.com_ and
add also a wildcard domain _*.your-domain.com_.

![Certificates request domains](./images/Certificates-Request_domains.png)

Choose DNS validation option, and click on *Create record in Route 53* button
for both naked domain and wildcard domain.

## Simple Email Service

First of all, verify *your-domain.com* domain. Go to *SES > Domains* and click *Verify a New Domain*.
When the DSN records are prompted, click on *Use Route 53*.

It should take few minutes to validate. Well done! Now it's time to start coding.

## Start coding

Create your git repo and init an npm package.

```bash
npm init
```

You may want to make it private, add in your *package.json*

```json
  "private": true,
```

If it is not a package to be installed as a dependency, I also like to disable *package-lock.json*.
Create a *.npmrc* file with the following content.

```
package-lock=false
```

Of course, create a *.gitignore* file, you can start with the following content

```
node_modules
```

Before start coding, I would go for [EditorConfig](http://EditorConfig.org).
Do not think it twice, you can add a *.editorconfig* file just launching

```bash
npm i dot-editorconfig -D
```

Install *typescript* and related packages.

```bash
npm i tsify tslib tslint typescript @types/node -D
```

Create the following *tsconfig.json* file in your project root folder.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": false,
    "charset": "utf8",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "importHelpers": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "noImplicitUseStrict": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "sourceMap": false,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "target": "es2017"
  }
}
```

Create *tslint.json* file too: I would start with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": ["tslint:latest"],
  "rules": {
    "member-access": [true, "no-public"],
    "no-implicit-dependencies": [true, "dev"],
    "ordered-imports": [true,
      {
        "named-imports-order": "lowercase-first"
      }
    ],
    "semicolon": [true, "never"],
    "trailing-comma": false
  }
}
```

Add the following scripts to your *package.json*:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "tsc--noemit": "tsc --declaration --project . --noemit",
    "tslint": "tslint --project ."
  }
```

And now, the fundamentalist (I am kidding:)) part: add a commit hook that run those basic checks. Install *pre-commit*:

```bash
npm i pre-commit -D
```

Add the following to your *package.json*:

```json
  "pre-commit": [
    "tsc--noemit",
    "tslint"
  ],
```

And now a git hook will run those npm scripts on commit. You can bypass it with `git commit -n`.

Install *aws-sdk* for JavaScript.

```bash
npm i aws-sdk
```

Write code to send emails, take a look at the following implementation:

* [api/sendEmail.ts](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/blob/Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS/api/sendEmail.ts)
* [api/emailTemplates.ts](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/blob/Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS/api/emailTemplates.ts)

Notice the *api/domainNames.ts* file that exports the `nakedDomain` variable, you may want to customize with your awesome domain.

Ok, let's give it a try. Create a file, for instance *sendMyFirstEmail.ts*, with a snippet like this

```typescript
import { sendCreateAccountEmail } from "./path/to/your/api/sendEmail"

sendCreateAccountEmail("your_email@gmail.com", "123", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err

  console.log(data)
})
```

Make it simple, just install TS stuff globally.

```bash
npm i ts-node typescript -g
```

Then send you email with:

```typescript
$ ts-node sendMyFirstEmail.ts
{ ResponseMetadata: { RequestId: 'a5eb6749-82ff-11e9-8d59-578481efc51f' },
  MessageId:
   '0100016b09c4ab82-db581946-60df-43fd-b56c-19ece2a0d2d1-000000' }
```

Yay, email arrived... a new company is being born...

Let me share this lesson I learned. This procedure works with *dot com*, and also *dot net* and maybe *dot info* domains. Well, I bought this domain: *geoch.at*. It did not worked.
I was not able to use Amazon SES with a *dot at* domain. Domain hacking is fun, but it is not worth for a company. Just get a *dot com* domain name.
People still don't get domain hacking, they expect a *dot com*. What a pity, I like so much Moldovian domain extension, ahahaha.

Ok, now that we can send emails, we can create a customer base. You may want to choose other authentication methods, for example via SMS, via GitHub, etc.
But let's use good old emails.

First we need to finish our setup.

## AWS CLI profile

Install [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).

**NOTA BENE**: AWS region is assumed to be **us-east-1**, also in AWS console region dropdown.

Get your AWS account id but we do not want to hardcode it. It is better to set it as an environment variable.

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123...
```

Get also AWS API keys and set them into your environment variables, it will be needed during development.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Set the environment variables above in your shell profile. For example [in my MacOS I use bash](https://g14n.info/2019/05/my-mac-terminal/) and they are configured in my *~/.bash_profile*.

We need also two other environment variables, but we can set them when needed, in particular when we create lambdas or want to run some code locally to debug it:

* `JWT_SECRET`: should be a long random string
* `AWS_REGION`: set to *us-east-1*.

Create (only once) the AWS CLI `Acme` profile locally. Remember that *Acme* is just a fake name, for instance in my side project I launched `aws configure --profile AWSMap`.

```bash
$ aws configure --profile Acme
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ***
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ***
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]:
```

### IAM

Create the following script: api/iam/generate-files.ts.

It imports few strings from the following files:

* [api/domainNames.ts](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/blob/Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS/api/domainNames.ts)
* [api/dynamo.ts](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/blob/Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS/api/dynamo.ts)
* [api/region.ts](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/blob/Serverless-React-PWA-on-AWS/api/region.ts)

So you can create the imported files adding only what is needed, for instance

```typescript
// api/domainNames.ts
export const nakedDomain = "your-domain.com"
```

```typescript
// api/dynamo.ts
export const tableNamePrefix = "Acme"
```

```typescript
// api/region.ts
export const region = "us-east-1"
```

Make sure required environment variables are set properly, then run it

```bash
ts-node api/iam/generate-files.ts
```

In your root repository folder *package.json* add the following scripts.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "iam_attach_policy": "aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:policy/${npm_package_config_policy} --role-name ${npm_package_config_role} --profile ${npm_package_config_profile}",
    "iam_create_role": "aws iam create-role --role-name ${npm_package_config_role} --assume-role-policy-document file://api/iam/trust-service.json --profile ${npm_package_config_profile}",
    "iam_create_policy": "aws iam create-policy --policy-name ${npm_package_config_policy} --policy-document file://api/iam/lambda-policy.json --profile ${npm_package_config_profile}",
  }
```

Create also a new *config* attribute, changing of course the values according to your *project name*.

```json
  "config": {
    "role": "AcmeApi",
    "policy": "AcmeLambda",
    "profile": "Acme"
  },
```

Create role and attach policies.

```bash
npm run iam_create_role
npm run iam_create_policy
npm run iam_attach_policy
```

## AWS Lambdas

We are going to use no framework for our AWS lambdas. In my opinion, AWS is the framework: it is not worth to add another layer on top. I just used npm scripts and few helper functions.

Let's start with a dummy lambda, you can check the final implementations in the links below:

* [create-account](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/tree/master/api/lambdas/create-account)
* [enter-account](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/tree/master/api/lambdas/enter-account)
* [reset-password](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/tree/master/api/lambdas/reset-password)
* [verify-email](https://github.com/fibo/aws-map.com/tree/master/api/lambdas/verify-email)

Every lambda has its own folder and a *package.json*. The code inside is up to you, but you needd to consider
that, even if you use plain JavaScript, you need some *build/* folder to create a **zip** file to be uploaded on AWS.

We are going to use TypeScript so, at the time of this writing, we need to transpile it, cause there is no TypeScript runtime on AWS Lambda yet ðŸ¤”. We have hence the following files:

* *package.json*
* *.npmrc*: contains `package-lock=false`
* *index.ts*

The main idea year is that an AWS Lambda is implemented in an npm package of its own;
for example in other projects I created a *src/* folder, and used JavaScript; programming is a creative process... you know

Add the following to the *.gitignore* in your repository.

```
# lambdas
build.zip
build/
```

All lambdas will be prefixed with the project name, for instance **acme-**. Here it is a sample *package.json* for *create account* lambda. It is worth to repeat that *Acme* in the following snippet should be changed with your *project name*... or you could just simplify and actually create the [Acme Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation).
You may also change the *author*, or you could give me undeserved credits (or make me the owner of Acme Corporation :) as well as the *license*, in case you want to create an OSS projec.

```json
{
  "name": "acme-create-account",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Acme account creation",
  "private": true,
  "main": "index.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "browserify": "browserify --node -x aws-sdk -p tsify -o build/index.js -s exports $npm_package_main",
    "create": "aws lambda create-function --region ${AWS_REGION} --profile ${npm_package_config_profile} --function-name ${npm_package_name} --description \"${npm_package_description}\" --runtime nodejs8.10 --handler index.handler --role arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/${npm_package_config_role} --zip-file fileb://build.zip",
    "create_log_group": "aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /aws/lambda/$npm_package_name",

    "postcreate": "npm run create_log_group; npm run set_timeout",
    "prebrowserify": "rm -rf build; mkdir build",
    "postcreate_log_group": "npm run set_log_retention",
    "postdelete": "npm run delete_log_group",
    "precreate": "npm run zip",
    "predeploy": "npm run zip",
    "prezip": "rm build.zip; npm install; npm run browserify",
    "set_environment": "aws lambda update-function-configuration --region ${npm_package_config_region} --profile ${npm_package_config_profile} --function-name ${npm_package_name} --environment \"Variables={JWT_SECRET=$JWT_SECRET}\"",
    "set_log_retention": "aws logs put-retention-policy --region ${npm_package_config_region} --log-group-name /aws/lambda/$npm_package_name --retention-in-days $npm_package_config_log_retention",
    "set_timeout": "aws lambda update-function-configuration --region ${npm_package_config_region} --profile ${npm_package_config_profile} --function-name ${npm_package_name} --timeout ${npm_package_config_timeout}",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "zip": "cd build; zip -X -r ../build.zip * > /dev/null; cd .."
  },
  "config": {
    "log_retention": 7,
    "profile": "Acme",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "role": "AcmeApi",
    "timeout": 12
  },
  "author": "Gianluca Casati (http://g14n.info)",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {
    "browserify": "^16.2.3"
  }
}
```

Start with a dummy *index.ts*, it just respond with 200 HTTP status code and `{ "ok": true }` JSON payload.

```typescript
import response from "aws-lambda-res"

export async function handler(event, context) {
  response(200)({ ok: true })
}
```

Install this little helper, in your project root folder run

```bash
npm i aws-lambda-res
```

Now let's create our first lambda, remember to set the environment variables needed

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export JWT_SECRET=someSECRETrandomStringYouShouldAvo1dStor3AndPoss1blyChange1Toften
```

So, if TypeScript has no complains, launching npm script

```bash
npm run create
```

Will install deps, transpile code, generate a *build.zip* and upload it on AWS.
On success, it will also run scripts

```bash
npm run create_log_group
npm run set_timeout
npm run set_log_retention
```

Then you need to launch the following script

```bash
npm run set_environment
```

I prefer to launch it separately, cause it is worth to double check environment is set properly, rather
than trigger it on *postcreate*.

Another task I prefer to do manually, even if it could be automated, is:

1. Go on AWS Console and check that the AWS Lambda function was created as expected, on the desired region and so on...
2. Set a *Project* tag, for instance *Acme*. It will be handy to filter resources as well as separate budget.
